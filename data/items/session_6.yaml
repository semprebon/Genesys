  description: "A rune-covered dagger carved from a single piece of black obsidian.
      In the translucent material, shadows appear to roam at random, and those who
      hold it for more than a few minutes here faint whispers, becoming screams as
      the dagger strikes."
  implement:
    effect: "Any attack spell using this blade adds the close combat
      effect without increasing the difficulty of the check. An attack
      spell cast at a target engaged with the user increases its base damage by +3,
      and if the user is undead, heals the user for half the damage equal to that
      taken by the target."
